# Smart Traffic Surveillance System (ANPR + ATCC)

## Project Overview
This project implements a *Smart Traffic Surveillance System* using *Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)* and *Automatic Traffic Code Classification (ATCC)*. The system detects vehicles in video feeds, reads license plates, and classifies traffic rules violations in real time.

The solution is built using *YOLOv8* for detection and *OpenCV* for video processing.


## Features
- Detects multiple vehicles in a video stream
- Recognizes license plate numbers (ANPR)
- Classifies traffic violations (ATCC)
- Real-time video processing
- Works with webcam or pre-recorded videos
